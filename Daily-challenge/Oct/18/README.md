# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Notice that you may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
 

Constraints:

0 <= k <= 109
0 <= prices.length <= 104
0 <= prices[i] <= 1000 <br>

## Idea
Really hard DP question gonna explain when I got time<br>

## Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, k, prices):
        """
        :type k: int
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
    
        if not prices:
            return 0
        
        if k >= len(prices) // 2:
            return sum(
                x - y
                for x, y in zip(prices[1:], prices[:-1])
                if x > y)
        
        
        profits = [0]*len(prices)
        for j in range(k):

            preprofit = 0
            for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            
                profit = prices[i] - prices[i-1]
                preprofit = max(preprofit+profit, profits[i])
                profits[i] = max(profits[i-1], preprofit)
    
        return profits[-1]
```
