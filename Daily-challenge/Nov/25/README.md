# Smallest Integer Divisible by K
Given a positive integer K, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer N such that N is divisible by K, and N only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of N. If there is no such N, return -1.

Note: N may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: K = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
Example 2:

Input: K = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.
Example 3:

Input: K = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= K <= 105<br>

## Idea
Just do while loop and convert to decimal

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def smallestRepunitDivByK(self, K: int) -> int:
        remainder = 0
        for length_N in range(1,K+1):
            remainder = (remainder*10+1) % K
            if remainder == 0:
                return length_N
        return -1
        
```
