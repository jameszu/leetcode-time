# Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60
You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
Example 2:

Input: time = [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
 

Constraints:

1 <= time.length <= 6 * 104
1 <= time[i] <= 500 <br>

## Idea

## Code
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def findTilt(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        
        def value(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            
            left = value(node.left)
            right = value(node.right)
            tilt = abs(left-right)
            self.tilt += tilt
            return left + right + node.val
        self.tilt = 0
        value(root)
        
        return self.tilt
