# Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
Given a binary tree

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

 

Follow up:

You may only use constant extra space.
Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
 

Example 1:



Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the given tree is less than 6000.
-100 <= node.val <= 100 <br>

## Idea
yea ill ttyl

## Code
```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        s1, s2 = [], []
        while l1:
            s1.append(l1.val)
            l1 = l1.next
        
        while l2:
            s2.append(l2.val)
            l2 = l2.next
            
        carry = 0
        head = ListNode(0)
        while s1 or s2 or carry:
            if s1:
                carry += s1.pop()
            if s2:
                carry += s2.pop()
            carry, val = divmod(carry, 10)
            head.next, head.next.next = ListNode(val), head.next
        return head.next
```
