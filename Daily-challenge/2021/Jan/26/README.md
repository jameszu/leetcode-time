# Decode Ways
A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
Example 2:

Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
Example 3:

Input: s = "0"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no character that is mapped to a number starting with '0'. We cannot ignore a zero when we face it while decoding. So, each '0' should be part of "10" --> 'J' or "20" --> 'T'.
Example 4:

Input: s = "1"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).<br>

## Idea
Just do while loop and convert to decimal

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        for c in set(s):
            if s.count(c) < k:
                return max(self.longestSubstring(t, k) for t in s.split(c))
        return len(s)
        
```
