# Swap Nodes in Pairs
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes itself may be changed.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
Example 2:

Input: head = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 100.<br>

## Idea
Just do while loop and convert to decimal

## Code
```python
Didn't do it
