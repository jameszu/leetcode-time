Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

 

Constraints:

intervals[i][0] <= intervals[i][1]


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Ideas:
pointer i. start with the first item, use while loop to check if the last item in intervals[i] is greater or equal to intervals[i+1][0]. If so, intervals[i][-1] would become the max of [i+1][-1] and [i][-1] then we pop out the next ele i.e. intervals[i+1]. Otherwise just i+=1 for next item.
